# CoverMyMeds MCP Server

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- CMM API backend running on `http://localhost:3000`

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Claude Desktop Integration

1. **Copy the configuration template**:
   ```bash
   cp claude-desktop-config.json ~/.claude-desktop-config.json
   ```

2. **Update the path** in your copied config file:
   - Replace `/path/to/cmm-mcp-server` with your actual project path
   - For example: `/Users/yourname/Projects/cmmdemo/cmm-mcp-server`

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new MCP server

#### Configuration Options

**For Production (recommended)**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cmm-mcp-server": {
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["dist/server.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/cmm-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "CMM_API_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        "CMM_API_KEY": "demo-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Development**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cmm-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "src/server.ts"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/cmm-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "CMM_API_URL": "http://localhost:3000", 
        "CMM_API_KEY": "demo-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: For production use, first build the project with `npm run build`

## üí° Example Usage

### Submit a Prior Authorization
```
Use the submit_prior_authorization tool to help Sarah Johnson get prior auth for Humira. She lives in Ohio, was born 1985-03-15, and needs it for rheumatoid arthritis. Her doctor thinks she needs this specific medication because she tried methotrexate for 6 months without improvement.
```

### Check Status
```
Check the authorization status for patient "John Smith" to see if his Humira request has been processed.
```

### Help with Forms
```
Use help_patient_with_forms to guide an elderly patient through completing their PA form. They have basic reading level and need extra help understanding medical questions.
```

### Find Alternatives
```
Humira was denied for coverage. Use find_alternative_medications to help find covered alternatives for treating rheumatoid arthritis.
```
